# Shadow Wallet.io

This application is intended to be a secure and easy way to access the assets in your hardware wallets, as well as their values, but without accessing them at all.  I present to you, the 'shadow' wallet, so to speak.

By simply manually putting in the data during setup, and of course changing it as more coins are acquired or some coins are spent, you can access the data without having access to the actual wallet.  I intend for this app to also allow an array of custom plotting options for the charts (past hour, past week, including which assets, etc.).

### Install Requirements!
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Updates Coming Soon!
More to come in the near-future, going through a moving process at the moment!
